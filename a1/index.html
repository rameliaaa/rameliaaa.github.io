          >1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?</b
        >
        When I first opened up luni, I found myself drawn to the soft pastel
        colours of the site that went along with the playful graphics that
        seemed to move when being interacted with. Further, the smooth nature of
        the scroll between pages intrigued me.

          >2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.</b
        >
        Scrolled between pages, Clicked on clickable elements that made the
        graphics move, Continuing to play around with engaging elements and
        shift around the moving elements of the site. Briefly clicked on the
        linked information

      <li>
        <b
          >3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?</b
        >
        I definitely felt I spent the majority of my time engaging with the home
        pages especially over the information parts of each section. I found the
        visuals used within these home pages most eye catching and interesting.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
          with the experience?</b
        >
        Moving between the different home pages that were displayed like little
        worlds, playing around with how little things moved when you hovered
        over them and clicked on them. Some were also game-like features where
        if you scored, your points would go up.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b
          >5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?</b
        >
        I felt luni wanted to intrigue and showcase the creative nature of their
        company and careers to potential customers and clients. Specifically
        those who were interested in the site's aesthetics and engagement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
          goal?</b
        >
        Throughout the site, the company uses both a modern yet artsy aesthetic
        as well as playful user interaction. Their site is overall quite
        advanced with this user engagement therefore putting a good first
        impression on creatives interested in careers in their company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</b
        >
        My impression of the reaction time of luni, is the first one or two
        times entering the site you begin to interact with the different movable
        worlds that display each homepage. Throughout this the longer spent the
        more you are able to find the little details of user experience with
        hidden movables. It's then after searching through these four pages you
        might click on the discoveries of each homepage taking a slower approach
        to scrolling through each section of information. I believe this aspect
        would only be engaged once unless returning to specific information.

          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?</b
        >
        I feel luni’s design is created to discover more hidden elements the
        longer you interact with it. Little movements and expressions only
        really become noticeable to the user after revisiting pages, clicking on
        random items and moving your cursor in places not originally seen as
        containing information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?</b
        >
        Within each user interaction there is obvious reference to basic mobile
        games with singular purposes. However, the way the homepages are
        designed makes me think of more complex pc/console indie game
        aesthetics.

          10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?</b
        >
        The playful game-like references make you want to mess around with
        luni’s site, engaging with every piece of information in a pursuit of a
        kind of gratification. This could reference the company's hands-on and
        ambitious traits and about trying to succeed highly with your goals.
      </li>

        <b
          >11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
          should feel when engaging with your research experience?</b
        >
        I feel like luni wants you to feel ambitious and aspired by their site
        and its features, a theme of success is relevant throughout their
        game-like features of the homepages. To score goals within your career
        and hopefully score goals for them within a career at luni. I feel like
        they also evoke a sense of community and sustainability just following
        along with the indie aesthetic commonly associated with a smaller
        business.

          >12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </b>
        I felt the placement of the index to be a little bit inconvenient for
        users as it sometimes popped up when trying to click on other aspects
        such as the link to the discover page or even when engaging with the
        movable objects in the homepage. I also wasn’t interested in the
        aesthetic choices made to the index, it's programmed to lean slightly
        depending on where you move your cursor and whilst I get the aesthetic
        relevance, I just found it a bit annoying.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?</b
        >
        The aesthetic choices such as the colour and texture of the page and its
        overall cohesiveness was very satisfying. Further, The smoothness of the
        scroll and click movements were very enjoyable.
